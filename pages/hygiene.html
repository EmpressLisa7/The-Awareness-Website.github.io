<h2>These are problems for hygiene, their solutions and preventions.</h2>

  <p class="p-1">1. Poor Sanitation.</p> 
     <img class="image-1" src="../assets/Poor Sanitation.webp">
     <p class="p-1">(i)   Explanation.</p> 
     <p class="p-2">Poor Sanitation is when people who live in a distinct setting don't have 
      access to safe water, a sound sewage system, and a dirty environment. 
      More importantly, it lacks access to proper toilet facilities.</p>
     <p class="p-1">(ii)  Solutions.</p> 
     <p class="p-2">
      Creating demand for sanitation services.
      Promoting good sanitation behaviors.
      Generating access to latrines and sanitation services.
      Institutionalizing good governance, management and maintenance of these systems.</p>
     <p class="p-1">(iii) Preventions</p> 
     <p class="p-2">The text emphasizes the importance of improving access to clean water, 
      promoting proper waste management, enhancing sanitation facilities, educating the community, 
      supporting health policies, encouraging community involvement, and investing in infrastructure 
      development to ensure clean water, proper waste management, and hygiene practices.</p>
  <p class="p-1">2. Food Poisoning.</p>
     <img class="image-1" src="../assets/Food Poisoning.jpg">
     <p class="p-1">(i)   Explanation.</p> 
     <p class="p-2">Food poisoning, also called foodborne illness, is an infection or irritation 
      of your digestive tract that spreads through food or drinks. Viruses, bacteria, and parasites 
      cause most food poisoning. Harmful chemicals may also cause food poisoning.</p>
     <p class="p-1">(ii)  Solutions.</p> 
     <p class="p-2">To ensure food safety, follow these steps: wash hands, cook food thoroughly, store food 
      properly, check expiration dates, educate on food safety practices, encourage regular inspections, and 
      promote awareness of foodborne illnesses. Regular inspections and compliance with safety regulations are 
      crucial for maintaining food safety.</p>
     <p class="p-1">(iii) Preventions</p> 
  <p class="p-2">To ensure food safety, practice good hygiene, separate raw and cooked foods, cook food to 
   appropriate internal temperatures, store food safely, monitor expiration dates, educate food handlers, and 
   conduct regular inspections. Regular health inspections and reporting of unsafe practices can help prevent 
   cross-contamination and ensure food safety.</p>
